Amortized analysis 


Amortize;
noun,
To gradually pay off an initial cost over a period.


Amortized analysis is a useful technique when typical worst-case analysis is too pessimistic.

For example, 



Many kinds of complex algorithms benefit from amortized analysis; we get a clearer picture of their performance when we do an amortized analysis than with tpyical worst-case asymptotic analysis. 


In amortized analysis, we look at the cost not of individual operations, but of a sequence of operations. This allows us to look at th average cost per operation, which is often a better predictor of performance
