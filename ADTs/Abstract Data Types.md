An Abstract Data Type (ADT) abstracts away the structure of data from the data itself. It defines only a set of methods (in other words, an interface) which must be conformed to. The implementation details are not important.

Thus, instead of thinking about how the data is physically stored in memory[](), we think in terms of operations we can perform on the data. 

This has approach has many advantages:
- Users of ADTs don't have to think about distracting details.
- It minimises coupling between the application and the data structures it consumes.
- 



ADTs are implemented using data structures and algorithms.
